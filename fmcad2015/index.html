                We study the link between real-time quasi-periodic
                architectures where computing units execute 'almost
                periodically' and the discrete-time quasi-synchronous
                abstraction that P. Caspi proposed for analyzing
                them. The simplicity of the abstraction is appealing:
                the only events are node activations; logical steps
                account for transmission delays; and no node may be
                activated more than twice between two successive
                activations of any other. The motivation is to verify
                properties of real-time distributed systems in the
                simpler discrete model.</p>

              <p>
                By formalizing the relation between quasi-periodic
                architectures and the quasi-synchronous abstraction
                using L. Lamport's happened before relation, we show
                that the abstraction is sound for systems of two
                nodes. After showing that the abstraction is not sound
                for general systems with three or more nodes, we give
                sufficient restrictions on communication topologies to
                recover soundness.
