        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> I am a Research Scientist at IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in the Advanced Cognitive Engineering research group.
          I received my <a href="./thesis/index.html">PhD [8]</a> from École normale supérieure (ENS) in Paris under the
          supervision of <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/">Marc
              Pouzet</a> and <a href="http://tbrk.org/">Timothy
              Bourke</a>. I have worked on the following topics</p>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Symbolic Simulation of synchronous programs with timers</strong>. We proposed a synchronous language
              where continuous behaviors are expressed as in Timed Safety Automata [9]. A program is compiled to purely discrete
              code that produces symbolic traces that each represent a set of concrete traces.</li>

            <li><strong>CloudLens a Scripting Language for
                  Analysing Semi-Structured Data</strong>. We designed a scripting language, built on top of JavaScript,
              with dedicated streaming features for analysing streams of raw data [7]. A CloudLens script extracts information
              from the data and either report error states (monitoring), or find the causes of a crash (troubleshooting).</li>


            <li><strong>The Quasi-Synchronous Abstraction</strong> is a discrete time abstraction proposed for analysing quasi-periodic
              architectures where computing units execute almost periodically. We showed that this abstraction is not sound
              for general systems and give necessary and sufficient conditions to recover soundness [6].</li>

            <li><strong>Loosely Time-Triggered
                   Architectures</strong> (LTTAs) are a proposal for implementing synchronous programs over networks of embedded
              controllers [3]. We showed that the deployment of a synchronous application can be modeled using a synchronous
              framework and present controller models that can be compiled for execution [4,5].</li>

            <li><strong>Antescofo as a ReactiveML Embedded Domain
                Specific Language (eDSL)</strong>. We gave a synchronous semantics to the <a href="http://repmus.ircam.fr/antescofo">Antescofo</a>              language, a DSL for authoring mixed music, and an alternative implementation of the sequencer based on an embedding
              inside a synchronous language, <a href="http://reactiveml.org">ReactiveML</a> [2]. We used this embedding to
              allow live coding with Antescofo [1].</li>
          </ul>

                    The synchronous language Lustre and its descendants have long been used to program and model discrete controllers. Recent
                    work shows how to mix discrete and continuous elements in a Lustre-like language called Zélus. The resulting
                    hybrid programs are deterministic and can be simulated with a numerical solver. In this article, we focus
                    on a subset of hybrid programs where continuous behaviors are expressed using timers, nondeterministic
                    guards, and invariants, as in Timed Safety Automata. We propose a source-to-source compilation pass to
                    generate discrete code that, coupled with standard operations on Difference-Bound Matrices, produces
                    symbolic traces that each represent a set of concrete traces.

                    In this thesis we study embedded controllers implemented as sets of unsynchronized periodic processes. Each process activates
                    quasi-periodically, that is, periodically with bounded jitter, and communicates with bounded transmission
                    delays. Such reactive systems, termed <i>quasi-periodic</i>, exist as soon as two
                    periodic processes are connected together. In the distributed systems literature they are also known
                    as synchronous real-time models. We focus on techniques for the design and analysis of such systems without
                    imposing a global clock synchronization.

                    Synchronous languages were introduced as domain specific languages for the design of reactive systems. They offer an ideal
                    framework to program, analyze, and verify quasi-periodic systems. Based on a synchronous approach, this
                    thesis makes contributions to the treatment of quasi-periodic systems along three themes: verification,
                    implementation, and simulation.

                    Verification: The <i>quasi-synchronous abstraction</i> is a discrete abstraction proposed by Paul Caspi
                    for model checking safety properties of quasi-periodic systems. We show that this abstraction is not
                    sound in general and give necessary and sufficient conditions on both the static communication graph
                    of the application and the real-time characteristics of the architecture to recover soundness. We then
                    generalize these results to multirate systems.

                    execution of an application running on a quasi-periodic system. We propose a unified framework that encompasses
                    both the application and the protocol controllers. This framework allows us to simplify existing protocols,
                    propose optimized versions, and give new correctness proofs. We instantiate our framework with a protocol
                    based on clock synchronization to compare the performance of the two approaches.

                    For such nondeterministic models, we propose a <i>symbolic simulation</i> scheme
                    inspired by model checking techniques for timed automata. We show how to compile a model mixing nondeterministic
                    continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics into a discrete program manipulating sets of possible values.
                    Each trace of the resulting program captures a set of possible executions of the source program.

                    Lors de la mise au point d'applications qui s'exécutent dans le nuage, les programmeurs ne peuvent souvent que tracer l'exécution
                    de leur code en multipliant les impressions. Cette pratique génère des quantités astronomiques de fichiers
                    de traces qu'il faut ensuite analyser pour trouver les causes d'un bogue. De plus, les applications combinent
                    souvent de nombreux micro-services, et les programmeurs n'ont qu'un contrôle partiel du format des données
                    qu'ils manipulent. Cet article présente CloudLens, un langage dédié à l'analyse de ce type de données
                    dites semi-structurées. Il repose sur un modèle de programmation flot de données qui permet à la fois
                    d'analyser les sources d'une erreur et de surveiller une application en cours d'exécution.

                    Many critical real-time embedded systems are implemented as a set of processes that execute periodically with bounded jitter
                    and communicate with bounded transmission delay. The 'quasi-synchronous' abstraction was introduced by
                    P. Caspi for model-checking the safety properties of applications running on such systems. The simplicity
                    of the abstraction is appealing: the only events are process activations; logical steps account for transmission
                    delays; and no process may be activated more than twice between two successive activations of any other.

                    we show, surprisingly, that it is not sound for general systems of more than two processes. Our central
                    result is to propose necessary and sufficient conditions on both communication topologies and timing

                  <p class="abstract">Loosely Time-Triggered Architectures (LTTAs) are a proposal for constructing distributed embedded control
                    systems. They build on the quasi-periodic architecture, where computing units execute 'nearly periodically',
                    by adding a thin layer of middleware that facilitates the implementation of synchronous applications.

                  <p class="abstract">
                    In this paper, we show how the deployment of a synchronous application on a quasi-periodic architecture can be modeled using
                    a synchronous formalism. Then we detail two protocols, Back-Pressure LTTA, reminiscent of elastic circuits,
                    and Time-Based LTTA, based on waiting. Compared to previous work, we present controller models that can
                    be compiled for execution, a simplified version of the Time-Based protocol and optimizations for systems
                    using broadcast communication. We also compare the LTTA approach with architectures based on clock synchronization.

                  <p class="abstract">Cyber-Physical Systems require distributed architectures to support safety critical real-time control.
                    Hermann Kopetz' Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA) has been proposed as both an architecture and a comprehensive
                    paradigm for systems architecture, for such systems. TTA offers the programmer a logical discrete time
                    compliant with synchronous programming, together with timing bounds. A clock synchronization protocol
                    is required, unless the local clocks used themselves provide the recquired accuracy. To relax the strict
                    requirements on synchronization imposed by TTA, Loosely Time-Triggered Architectures (LTTA) have been
                    proposed. In LTTA, computation and communication units are all triggered by autonomous, unsynchronized,
                    clocks. Communication media act as shared memories between writers and readers and communication is non
                    blocking. This is at the price of communication artifacts (such as duplication or loss of data), which
                    must be compensated for by using some "LTTA protocol". In this paper we pursue our previous work by providing
                    a unified presentation of the two variants of LTTA (token- and time-based), with simplified analyses.
                    We compare these two variants regarding performance and robustness and we provide ways to combine them.</p>

                  <p class="abstract">Antescofo is recently developed software for musical score following and mixed music: it automatically,
                    and in real-time, synchronizes electronic instruments with a musician playing on a classical instrument.
                    Therefore, it faces some of the same major challenges as embedded systems.</p>

                  <p class="abstract">The system provides a programming language used by composers to specify musical pieces that mix interacting
                    electronic and classical instruments. This language is developed with and for musicians and it continues
                    to evolve according to their needs. Yet its semantics has only recently been formally defined. This paper
                    presents a synchronous semantics for the core language of Antescofo and an alternative implementation
                    based on an embedding inside an existing synchronous language, namely ReactiveML. The semantics reduces
                    to a few rules, is mathematically precise and leads to an interpretor of only a few hundred lines. The
                    efficiency of this interpretor compares well with that of the actual implementation: on all musical pieces
                    we have tested, response times have been less than the reaction time of the human ear. Moreover, this
                    embedding permitted the prototyping of several new programming constructs, some of which are described
                    in this paper.</p>

                  <p class="abstract">Mixed music is about live musicians interacting with electronic parts which are controlled by a computer
                    during the performance. It allows composers to use and combine traditional instruments with complex synthesized
                    sounds and other electronic devices. There are several languages dedicated to the writing of mixed music
                    scores. Among them, the Antescofo language coupled with an advanced score follower allows a composer
                    to manage the reactive aspects of musical performances: how electronic parts interact with a musician.
                    However these domain specific languages do not offer the expressiveness of functional programming.</p>

                  <p class="abstract">We embed the Antescofo language in a reactive functional programming language, ReactiveML. This approach
                    offers to the composer recursion, higher order, inductive types, as well as a simple way to program complex
                    reactive behaviors thanks to the synchronous model of concurrency on which ReactiveML is built. This
                    article presents how to program mixed music in ReactiveML through several examples.</p>
